# PMS
Pi Mouse Studio for Synchronize Capture of Mouse Posture Patterns in 3D and Wide-Field Cotical Imaging
Still in progress to upload code

Repository for PMS legacy which is based on legacy Picam module: https://github.com/tf4ong/pms_legacy
Still working on organizing the code.
Example video: of multi-angle capture: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcjDqLt_Xk5TglISZdtQKfrm63VQVVpf


However, we recommend to use the new Picam2 module which allows greater control of camera properties and image/video produced. Will be uploaded shortly.
